# go-instafollowers

A simple Go CLI app for managing your Instagram followers.


**To avoid any confusion:**

- It CANNOT help you get more Instagram followers;
- It CAN list users you are following / being followed by;
- It CAN list users who are not following you back;
- It CAN help you keep track of who followed / unfollowed you;
- It CAN help you follow / unfollow user(s).

You can do all that while not having to deal with any pesky ads or having to give away your personal information. This app is entirely open source too.
